djtodo
======

Client side to-do list

setup
-----

For setup first you should have installed python-django in your system.
If unfortunately you do not have, do::

    $ sudo pip install django

and if you have installed then check the version if it is 1.5 or not because I have coded it in 1.5.4. So, I am not sure if it can run on other versions too, better you do::

    $ sudo pip install django --update

Now, clone this repositry::

    $ git clone https://github.com/iamsudip/djtodo

Okay. Ready to go now.


How to use
----------

cd into recently cloned 'djtodo' and do::

    $ sudo python manage.py runserver

The server will start running at localhost port 8000 (default).

Without closing the terminal open a web browser and go to this address::

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/

you will see nothing there, because you never added a to-do list.

To add tasks to list you can use the button.

To view admin page go to this address::

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

you will see admin page(Do not worry, It will not ask you for username/password).

Simply add to do list using the form and use the code like above.

**If you type wrong address you will land on a error page automatically generated by django**
